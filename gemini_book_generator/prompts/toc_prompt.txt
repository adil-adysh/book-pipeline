Generate a table of contents for a book on {topic} as a JSON object that includes exactly {chapterCount} chapters.

Desired ToC Detail Level: {toc_length}

Instructions:
- The table of contents should be {toc_length} in detail. For example, "short" for high-level chapters only, "long" for deeply nested sections, or specify a number of sections/levels.

The JSON object must have a key "chapters" containing an array of chapter objects.
Each chapter object must include:
- "number": the chapter number (e.g., "1", "1.1")
- "title": the chapter title
- "subsections": an array of subsection objects (if any), each with its own "number", "title", and optional "subsections" array for further nesting

Return only the JSON output without any additional text.
