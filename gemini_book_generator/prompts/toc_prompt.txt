You are an expert content creator specializing in accessible education.  
Generate a detailed table of contents for a book on {topic} as a JSON object that includes exactly {chapterCount} chapters.  

The JSON object must have a key "chapters" containing an array of chapter objects.  
Each chapter object must include:  
- "number": the chapter number (e.g., "1", "1.1")  
- "title": the chapter title  
- "subsections": an array of subsection objects (if any), each with its own "number", "title", and optional "subsections" array for further nesting  

If subtopics are provided (e.g., {subTopics}), integrate them into the JSON structure as dedicated entries—either as separate chapters or as sub-chapters—according to their relevance.  

Return only the JSON output without any additional text.
